# Tappy-Hands

This project is something I did based on an old Udemy tutorial. The following are the things that are different from the tutorial's code base:
- Programmatic UI
- MVVM architecture
- Coding style
- Code organization
- Subclasses
- Extensions
- Code documentation
- Updates for the deprecated API/s

The following are the main features of this project:
- Allows saving of high scrore using `UserDefaults`
- Has countdown before the game starts and for the actual game's time limit using `Timer`
- Score sharing using `UIActivityViewController` and `MFMailComposeViewController`
- Game controls using `THButton`, a subclass of `UIButton`
- Supports multiple screen sizes (both iPad and iPhone)
- Has ads using `Google AdMob`

TODO:
[] Fix screen layout on landscape mode
[] In-app purchase

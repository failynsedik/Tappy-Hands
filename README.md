# Tappy-Hands

This project is something I did based on an old Udemy tutorial. The following are the things that are different from the tutorial's code base:
- Programmatic UI
- MVVM architecture
- Coding style
- Code organization
- Subclasses
- Extensions
- Code documentation
- Updates for the deprecated API/s
